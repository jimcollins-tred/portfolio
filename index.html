            I am a Manchester-based developer and designer, and throughout my
            career I’ve been guided by these twin passions. I’ve loved coding
            since I was a young boy writing text adventures in BASIC, and have
            always enjoyed the unique mix of creativity and problem-solving it
            requires. I also love a challenge. In the last year I’ve taught
            myself HTML5 and CSS, and am a recent graduate of Northcoders coding
            bootcamp, where I relished the chance to build upon my background in
            Computer Science and learn the latest exciting technologies.

          <p class="para">
            In my design work, I have over fifteen years’ experience working on
            a wide variety of projects. The key to great design has always been
            great communication. I collaborate closely with my clients to fully
            understand their needs, then use attractive, considered design to
            deliver their message to its audience with maximum clarity and
            impact.

            Above all I love to tell a story, be that through the websites I
            design and build or the fiction I write. My goal is to unite these
            interests, creating beautiful websites and applications that excite,
            inspire and inform their users.

            I began my professional career in website development, working for
            clients such as M&S and the University of Cambridge. I've recently
            rediscovered my love of coding, and during my time at Northcoders I
            worked on numerous exciting projects, some of which can be seen by

            swept up by Beethoven and Mozart for Classic FM, and I’ve rambled
            with the, er, Ramblers.
