          Chickenshed is an inclusive theatre company based in North London. Its
          core philosophy is that performing arts should be open to everyone,
          regardless of background or ability level.

        <p class="para">
          This unique coffee-table book was commissioned as a celebration of
          their 40 year anniversary. I was responsible for the entire design
          lifecycle, and at every stage I collaborated closely with publisher
          Elliot & Thompson, author Elizabeth Thomson and the Chickenshed team
          to ensure the company’s pioneering work was perfectly showcased.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Given the company’s commitment to inclusivity, design elements such as
          font choice and type size were also carefully considered to ensure the
          book was accessible to as many people as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Stunning photography, a wonderful story and an inspiring client: truly
          a rewarding project of which to be a part.

          Chickenshed champions diversity and inclusion, and many of its

          The final design strove to be clean and elegant, with liberal use of
          white space to allow the photography to shine. Earlier treatments,
          however, used theatrical motifs to create a bold, dramatic look.
