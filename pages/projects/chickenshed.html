            Chickenshed is an inclusive theatre company based in North London.
            Its core philosophy is that performing arts should be open to
            everyone, regardless of background or ability level.

          <p class="para">
            This unique coffee-table book was commissioned as a celebration of
            their 40 year anniversary. I was responsible for the entire design
            lifecycle, and at every stage I collaborated closely with publisher
            Elliot & Thompson, author Elizabeth Thomson and the Chickenshed team
            to ensure the company’s pioneering work was perfectly showcased.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Given the company’s commitment to inclusivity, design elements such
            as font choice and type size were also carefully considered to
            ensure the book was accessible to as many people as possible.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Stunning photography, a wonderful story and an inspiring
            client: truly a rewarding project of which to be a part.

          Chickenshed champions diversity and inclusion, and many of its
          students are not conventionally able. Belinda Sharer, below, has
          severe cerebral palsy, yet feels liberated by her performances at

          The final design strove to be clean and elegant, with liberal use of
          white space to allow the photography to shine. Earlier treatments,
          however, used theatrical motifs to create a bold, dramatic look.
