            Meme What You Say is a real-time, multiplayer iOS app that
            challenges players to come up with the funniest captions for popular
            memes.

          <p class="para">
            Users can host or join private games, entering captions for a
            randomly-generated series of pictures before voting on their
            favourite ones. After each round they are taken to a leaderboard
            showing them who supplied the best caption. The scores are added up
            and an overall winner crowned at the end of the game.

            This was the final group project of the Northcoders bootcamp, and
            was completed with my team-mates Rachel Caruso-Bryant, Bella Royle
            and Tom Hogg. Throughout the project we used Agile practices such as
            daily standups, kanban boards, mob programming and pair programming
            to aid in the development of the app. We were also excited to
            explore two new technologies: React Native and Google Firebase.

            One of the greatest challenges on this project was also one of its
            greatest draws: the use of exciting new technology. For the
            front-end we used React Native. Whilst it differs from React for web
            in significant ways, our existing familiarity with React made
            learning React Native an achievable (and enjoyable) challenge.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            For the back end we used Google Firebase and its Cloud Firestore
            database, enabling us to synchronise all of our users around a
            common source of data. It also provided us with database listeners
            that would prompt various real-time events, such as score updates
            and screen progressions.

            Probably the greatest challenge of this project arose from the
            realtime nature of the game and its need for numerous asynchronous
            calls to the database. Both state and page rendering had to be
            carefully managed to avoid loading issues, as did the storage of
            information between rounds to ensure there were no conflicts. Moving
            all players to the next screen in unison was another technical
            hurdle, requiring the use of database listeners to manage navigation
            centrally.

            The above videos show the game lobby updating in real-time as a new
            player joins. When the lobby gains the required minimum number of
            players (3), a ‘Begin Round’ button appears for the host only. Upon
            pressing this button, a flag is set in the database indicating we
            can proceed to the next round. A database listener in each user’s
            app will register this change, triggering a simultaneous transition
            to the next screen for all players.
