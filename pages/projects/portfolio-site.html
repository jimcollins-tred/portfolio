            For my personal profile website, not only was I keen to showcase my
            work, I also wanted the site itself to be a demonstration of my
            design and coding skills.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            The site was initially wire-framed and designed using UXPin,
            allowing me to nail the look and feel before I commenced the build.
            I strove for a clean yet bold look, with judiciously-used animations
            to bring sections to life. I developed the grid structure of the
            site in UXPin, allowing for a relatively painless transferral into
            CSS Grid.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            The site began life before I learnt React. There was the obvious
            temptation to redevelop it, but instead I saw it as an excellent
            opportunity to hone my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills without
            relying on frameworks.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            The site is also fully responsive, displaying perfectly on
            everything from a wide-screen desktop to a phone.

            I initially looked into event listeners to trigger the various
            animations, but found them too resource-intensive. Instead I used
            Intersection Observer, an excellent API that enabled me to observe
            elements on a page and trigger animated transitions whenever they
            scrolled into the viewport.

            Intersection Observer also allowed me to trigger the playing of
            videos only when they scroll into the viewport, and to pause them
            when they leave.

          <h4 class="section__subhead">A modular approach</h4>
          <p class="para">
            One of the great benefits of React, of course, is how easy it makes
            building modular, reusable components. To replicate this with
            standard HTML and JavaScript, I turned to Web Components. Rather
            than replicate the nav code on every page, I instead encapsulated
            both the HTML and JS logic inside a component that could be reused
            throughout the site. This was also helpful for the header, footer,
            hero image and ‘contact me’ elements of the site.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Additionally I used SCSS to modularise my CSS into a logical
            structure.

          <h4 class="section__subhead">Nav menu</h4>
          <p class="para">
            One element I was particularly pleased with was the popup navigation
            menu. The background animation was achieved by displaying a zero
            width and height circle in the top right corner, which was then
            scaled to fill the screen when the menu icon was clicked. Likewise
            the menu itself was a zero-width div on the left-hand side of the
            page, transitioned to full-page width to give the appearance of it
            sliding into view.

        <div class="spotlight__intro">
          <p class="para">
            The hover animation for individual menu items required the use of a
            background gradient clipped to the text. The background appeared
            pale at first, but upon hover was shifted to the right to reveal a
            more solid colour, providing an eye-catching effect.
