						Tred were a pioneering fintech, empowering businesses to track their spending and
						carbon footprint through a debit card and mobile app. I gained over three years'
						experience of commercial app development, working in a small, talented Agile team.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						I played a key role in shaping our digital experiences across mobile, web, and
						back-end systems. Leveraging React Native and TypeScript, I helped build a dynamic,
						robust and feature-packed mobile banking app for both iOS and Android. I was also
						working on extending the functionality of our web portal using React and Next.js.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						On the back-end, I worked extensively with Amazon Web Services. The primary language
						was again TypeScript, and we deployed to AWS using the Serverless framework and an
						Infrastructure-As-Code approach.

					I was also part of Tredâ€™s design team. Drawing on my graphic design background, I
					ensured our applications were not only functionally robust but also user-friendly and
					visually engaging.
				</p>
				<p class="para">
					My design background gives me a solid understanding of great UX / UI that has proved
					extremely useful in my front-end work. I used Figma extensively to create attractive,
					user-focussed screen designs and prototypes that could be easily implemented by myself
					or other developers.

					<h4 class="section__subhead">Home screen redesign</h4>
					<p class="para">
						This year, we commissioned two UX designers to gather feedback on the app from our
						users. Based on their findings, I led a complete redesign of the app home screen, from
						concept to implementation.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						The most common complaint was that the home screen was too busy and packed with
						information that wasn't required every time users opened the app. Listing open banking
						accounts was deemed distracting, and users felt the always-open transaction panel took
						up too much space.
					</p>

					<div class="spotlight__image__row animUp">
						<img
							src="/img/Portfolio/Projects/Tred/Tred_Home_Orig.png"
							alt="Original Tred home screen"
							class="spotlight__image__item"
						/>
						<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right spotlight__icon"></i>
						<img
							src="/img/Portfolio/Projects/Tred/Tred_Home.png"
							alt="Original Tred home screen"
							class="spotlight__image__item"
						/>
					</div>

					<p class="para">
						The redesign displays information in a cleaner, less cluttered way. The balance is
						displayed clearly at the top, and open banking accounts are tidied away into their own
						menu that's easily accessible by tapping the account selector arrow.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						Meanwhile, only the most recent transactions are displayed, with a simple button to
						bring up all transactions. Context-sensitive shortcut buttons also provide quick
						access to the features our users deem most important, such as PIN and account details.
						These shortcuts change depending on the type of account selected - Tred or open
						banking.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						Finally this new home screen is designed to be modular. Additionally widgets can be
						added as required - such as the 'Green Money' widget shown above - with the screen now
						dynamically scrolling to accommodate this.
					</p>

					<h4 class="section__subhead">Animations</h4>
					<p class="para">
						The new app also features various animations I implemented using a mixture of Rive,
						React Native Reanimated and CSS.
					</p>

					<div class="video__row videoMulti animUp">
						<video width="100%" height="auto" loop class="video__single">
							<source src="/img/Portfolio/Projects/Tred/vids/App_Open.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
							Your browser does not support the video tag.
						</video>
						<video width="100%" height="auto" loop class="video__single">
							<source
								src="/img/Portfolio/Projects/Tred/vids/App_Transactions.mp4"
								type="video/mp4"
							/>
							Your browser does not support the video tag.
						</video>
					</div>
					<p class="para">
						The opening animation on the left was designed as a fun, on-brand alternative to a
						loading spinner. The trees grow gradually as the app fetches required data during
						launch. I designed and implemented this animation using Rive, a tool that allows the
						creation of slick animations and their easy integration into frameworks like React
						Native.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						On the right we have the header animation driven by the opening of the transaction
						drawer. The transaction drawer uses React Native Reanimated for the drawer open
						animation, which provides a precise Animated Value for the current open height of the
						drawer. I used this to synchronise the header transition animation with the opening of
						the drawer.
