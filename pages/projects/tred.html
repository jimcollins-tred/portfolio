						Tred were a pioneering fintech, empowering businesses to track their spending and
						carbon footprint through a debit card and app. I gained over three years' experience
						of commercial app development, working in a small, highly talented Agile team.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						I played a key role in shaping our digital experiences across mobile, web, and
						back-end systems. Leveraging React Native and TypeScript, I helped build a dynamic,
						robust and feature-packed mobile banking app for both iOS and Android. I was also
						working on extending the functionality of our web portal using React and Next.js.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						On the back-end, I worked extensively with Amazon Web Services. The primary language
						was again TypeScript, and we deployed to AWS using the Serverless framework and an
						Infrastructure-As-Code approach.

					<h4 class="section__subhead">Intersection Observer</h4>
					<p class="para">
						I initially looked into event listeners to trigger the various animations, but found

						whenever they scrolled into the viewport.

					<h4 class="section__subhead">A modular approach</h4>
					<p class="para">
						One of the great benefits of React, of course, is how easy it makes building modular,
						reusable components. To replicate this with standard HTML and JavaScript, I turned to
						Web Components. Rather than replicate the nav code on every page, I instead
						encapsulated both the HTML and JS logic inside a component that could be reused
						throughout the site. This was also helpful for the header, footer, hero image and
						‘contact me’ elements of the site.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						Additionally I used SCSS to modularise my CSS into a logical structure.

					<h4 class="section__subhead">Nav menu</h4>
					<p class="para">
						One element I was particularly pleased with was the popup navigation menu. The
						background animation was achieved by displaying a zero width and height circle in the
						top right corner, which was then scaled to fill the screen when the menu icon was
						clicked. Likewise the menu itself was a zero-width div on the left-hand side of the
						page, transitioned to full-page width to give the appearance of it sliding into view.

				</video>
				<div class="spotlight__intro">
					<p class="para">
						The hover animation for individual menu items required the use of a background
						gradient clipped to the text. The background appeared pale at first, but upon hover
						was shifted to the right to reveal a more solid colour, providing an eye-catching
						effect.
