						Tred were a pioneering fintech, empowering businesses to track their spending and
						carbon footprint through a debit card and mobile app. I gained over three years'
						experience of commercial app development, working in a small, talented Agile team.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						I played a key role in shaping our digital experiences across mobile, web, and
						back-end systems. Leveraging React Native and TypeScript, I helped build a dynamic,
						robust and feature-packed mobile banking app for both iOS and Android. I was also
						working on extending the functionality of our web portal using React and Next.js.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						On the back-end, I worked extensively with Amazon Web Services. The primary language
						was again TypeScript, and we deployed to AWS using the Serverless framework and an
						Infrastructure-As-Code approach.

					I was also part of Tredâ€™s design team. Drawing on my graphic design background, I
					ensured our applications were not only functionally robust but also user-friendly and
					visually engaging.
				</p>
				<p class="para">
					My design background gives me a solid understanding of great UX / UI that has proved
					extremely useful in my front-end work. I used Figma extensively to create attractive,
					user-focussed screen designs and prototypes that could be easily implemented by myself
					or other developers.

					<p class="para">
						This year, we commissioned two UX designers to gather feedback on the app from our
						users. Based on this, I then led a complete redesign of the app home screen, from
						concept to implementation.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						The most common complaint was that the home screen was too busy and packed with
						information users would not need to see upon app open. Listing open banking accounts
						was deemed unnecessary clutter, as was the transactions panel which took up the entire
						bottom half of the screen.
					</p>
					<p class="para">
						Users also wanted quick access to important features like their PIN and account
						details, and quick access to customer support.
